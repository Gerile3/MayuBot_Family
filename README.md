# Welcome!

Here is a collection repo of the bots that i have make over the course of my python learning journey. Twitter and instagram ones can be seen as early alpha versions while discord and telegram ones mostly done and actively getting used by me in my servers.

## Bots

* ### Mayubot_Twitter

  Twitter bot to find anime name from the gifs or pictures, she can also do google image search. To use her simply mention her in the post you would like to get the name and she will answer back in 5 mins. You can find her [here](https://twitter.com/MayuBot1).

* ### Mayubot_Telegram

  A Telegram bot that can be used for fun & checking quick things (e.g weather, daily horoscope..). Check her [here](https://github.com/Gerile3/MayuBot_Telegram).

* ### Mayubot_Discord

  Discord bot that i have made to use on servers that i have own, she can do various things including listening songs in voice chat to search google for anything as well as playing little games. She is a shy one so only working in my server for now but you can see her in action [here](https://github.com/Gerile3/MayuBot_Family/tree/master/Mayubot_Discord).

* ### Mayubot_Instagram

   Made her to post pixel art that i have liked across the internet. She also posts maker of the art if you would like to check more. Find her [here](https://www.instagram.com/mayu.bot/).

## How

I have written them in python with the help of official apis for the platforms.

## Where

They are currently living in my raspberry pi

## Future

I will keep improving them and will try to fix problems, bugs that "we" find
